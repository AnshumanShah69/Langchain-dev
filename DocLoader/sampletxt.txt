Story mode games are a genre of video games that focus heavily on narrative, character development, and emotional engagement. Unlike competitive or multiplayer games that emphasize skill-based mechanics, story-driven games immerse players in carefully crafted worlds where choices, dialogue, and actions often shape the outcome of the plot.
